This project aims to revolutionize the field of botany and biodiversity studies by developing a large-scale, multi-modal foundation model, to identify and analyze millions of Herbaria samples.

Right now, the research process on preserved plant samples is highly manual. It is also very prone to mistakes, as there is much suspicion of misnaming of samples.

The objective of our work is to enhance botanists' ability to investigate and draw insights with said samples. This is important since Herbaria samples are often the basis of the knowledge about climate change, evolution and biological lifecycles. Therefore, our work holds immense potential for transformative impact. By providing a deeper understanding of plant species and their ecosystems, we can better strategize on preserving biodiversity and even discover new species.
