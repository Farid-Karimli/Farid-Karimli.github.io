AirMouse allows you to control your mouse pointer with your hand movements through your webcam. Point with your finger to move the mouse and pinch your thumb and index finders to click. More gestures and customization options to come. AirMouse not only enhances your productivity but also frees you from the constraints of traditional input devices. Whether you're presenting, designing, coding, or just browsing, AirMouse provides a seamless and intuitive experience. It's not just a new way to control your computer - it's a whole new way to experience it.

AirMouse is in development. Contributions to the [repo](https://github.com/Farid-Karimli/AirMouse) are welcome!
