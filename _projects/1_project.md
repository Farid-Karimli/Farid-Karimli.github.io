We developed CameraMouseAI, a system that enables real-time facial feature detection for mouse control. Users can perform mouse commands, such as clicks, by raising their eyebrows or opening their mouth, in addition to traditional dwell-time selection. The open-source platform allows for easy updates and extensions with new computer vision and machine learning models. In tests, both users with and without motor impairments successfully used CameraMouseAI for tasks like target selection and web browsing.
