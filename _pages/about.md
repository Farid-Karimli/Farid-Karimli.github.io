<u>As of Feb 2024</u>: This is a brand new website, and it is not up-to-date yet. In particular the projects page is not populated yet.

I'm a Data Science MS student at Boston University. I did my undergraduate in Computer Science there too. I am part of the Image and Video Research Group, working on video-based human-computer interfaces and assistive technology. My background is in data science, machine learning and software development.

In many ways, my work has been human-centered. I have led and worked on projects that span many domains: healthcare, public policy, linguistics and more.
More specifically, these involved working on facial and gesture recognition/tracking in assistive software, investigating health and police data, and more.

My interests are primarily in computer vision, human-computer interaction, neural networks and plain old data science. I am also passionate about teaching. Overall, my goal is to educate and work on developing impactful AI solutions that help people be more productive and effective, and are grounded in ethical and legal considerations.
