<u>As of Feb 2024</u>: This is a brand new website, and it is not up-to-date yet. In particualar the projects page is not populated yet.

I'm a Data Science MS student at Boston University. I did my undergraduate in Computer Science there too. I am part of the Image and Video Research Group, working on video-based human-computer interfaces and assistive technology. My background is in data science, machine learning and software development.

I have led and worked on projects that span many domains: healthcare, public policy, linguistics and more.

My interests are primarily in computer vision, human-computer interaction and neural networks. I am also passionate about teaching. My goal is to contribute to the development of innovative and impactful AI systems that make people's lives easier, and grounded in ethical and legal considerations.
